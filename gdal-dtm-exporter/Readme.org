#+title: Readme

* Prerequisites

~gdal~ needs to be in your PKG_CONFIG_PATH.

If you're on Arch (or similar) and don't mind installing things globally on your system, you can just do:

#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -Syu gdal
#+end_src

Then you'll probably also need a few extra packages as runtime dependencies (see https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues/6281 and https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/75749 to know why, this is a quirk just on Arch) :

~sudo pacman -Syu arrow podofo libpqxx~

I'm pretty sure ~gdal~ is packaged on other OSes too: for example via ~brew~ on macOS. In alternative, consider creating a ~conda~ environment and installing there.
